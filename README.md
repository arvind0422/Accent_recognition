# Accent & Speaker Recognition

Part of major project requirement for my undergraduate degree.

This project aims at identifying a speaker's regional language English accent from within
a predetermined set of Indian accents. The project was further extended to recognize
the speaker from a database of speakers where speakers can be enrolled. The frame-
work has been discussed in the report. The framework for the accent recognition task
begins with framing the signal the computing features, removing the silences using VAD.
The accent recognition further involves training the Universal Background Model(UBM),
computing statistics and classifying using ANN. The speaker recognition task uses the
same framework till VAD as the former problem. It further involves computing bottle-
neck features using a specially trained neural network for an utterance and computing
the cosine distance to identify the speaker.
